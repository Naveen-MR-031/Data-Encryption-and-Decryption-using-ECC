# Project Summary

## Backend

This repository has the complete source code for the backend. It includes all **server logic, API routes, and access to the database(i.e firebase)**. 

## Frontend

The front-end of this app contained a couple of features: 

- Login with **Email & Password**
- Login with Google using **Firebase Authentication**

Note: The source code for the front end is not available in this repository because I no longer have it on my computer. I do have a front end that is functioning and compiled on my mobile device where I have the app downloaded and have been using it.
If you really would like to see the front end running for demonstration, I can show you a recording video, or we can set up a live demo. I am currently in the process of renewing the front end, and will add to this repo the moment after I re-create the code. 


## Contact

Feel free to contact me for clarification and/or if you would like to arrange for a demo!
